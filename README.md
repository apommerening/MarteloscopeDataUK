The data in this repository relate to the paper "Rating experiments in forestry: How much agreement is there in tree marking?"

The filename includes the location, the year and the thinning type applied, e.g. Ae2012ThinningEx1.txt refers to the data from a low-thinning experiment held ar Ae in 2012. Ae2012ThinningEx2.txt contains the data of a crown-thinning experiment held at the same location in the same year.

The data are saved as text files and the data columns are tabulator delimited.

In each file, the data columns are organised as follows:

Treenumber: Number assigned to the tree described in a particular row <br>
Species: Tree species coded in letters using the UK Forestry Commission species codings, e.g. SS - Sitka spruce <br>
dbh: Stem diameter at breast height (1.3 m above ground level) in cm <br>
h: Total tree height in m <br>
Formfactor: Form factor describing the deviation of tree stem from a cylinder <br>
Quality: Qualitative assessment of timber quality using quality classes a-c <br>
X: Cartesian x coordinate of tree location in m <br>
Y: Cartesian y coordinate of tree location in m <br>

The following columns give the marking results, i.e. each rater is represented by one column. "0" means "not selected" and "1" means "selected".
